# Photo Blog

This is my first TypeScript project. It's an iteration of a blog project I built during my bootcamp experience. Extending on the basic blogging paradigm of a title with some content, the ability to upload photos and expose the included metadata will be integrated. The inspiration for this project came from a desire to build a platform for sharing stories outside of the existing social media offerings.
