# Photo Blog

This is my first TypeScript project. It's an iteration of a blog project I built during my bootcamp experience. Extending on the basic blogging paradigm of a title with some content, the ability to upload photos and expose the included metadata will be integrated. The inspiration for this project came from a desire to build a platform for sharing stories outside of the existing social media offerings.

## Getting Started

This is a Node project employing the following modules: 
- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- [Lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)
- [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)

Please note, it's necessary to install the TypeScript module corresponding to each of the above NPM packages using the following command.
> npm i @types/`module-name`.
